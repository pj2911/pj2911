- 👀 Hi, I’m Peter, I've recently embarked on a new career path in data analytics, and this is my portfolio page to showcase my work.
- 👋 I only started building this page on the 24th May 2022, so there won't be much content at the moment, but please check out what's here.
- 🌱 My first project is a case study to complete the "Google Data Analytics Profesional Certificate", please check out the links for details.
- 💞️ I'll be adding more content in the near future as I try to showcase the various techincal skills I've developed over the last few months.
- 📫 If you want to know a little bit more about me, please check out [coming soon....]
