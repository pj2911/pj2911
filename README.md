üëÄ Hi, I‚Äôm Peter. After many years working in the public and private sectors I recently took the opportunity to embark on a career path in data analytics. I've always enjoyed working with data (largely in Excel) but at the same time I knew that there was a much wider world of possibilities with data that I wasn't tapping into. When the opportunity came along to take a redundancy package and tackle a new challenge I jumped at the chance. I've spent the last few months studying Power BI, Azure, SQL, R and Tableau and this is my portfolio page to showcase my work.

‚è≥ I created this page on the 24th May 2022, so there's only a small amount of content at the moment. I'll be adding more content in the near future as I try to showcase the various technical skills I've developed over the last few months.

üå± My first project is a case study to complete the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate", please check out the following links for details:
  1) This pdf contains an export of the reports I built in Power BI. [Case Study - Cyclistic.pdf]   (https://github.com/pj2911/pj2911/files/8771087/Case.Study.-.Cyclistic.pdf)
  2) This presentation provides an overview of the project including: Business Task, Key Observations, Conclusions & Next Steps and Appendix
[Case Study - Cyclistic Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/pj2911/pj2911/files/8771109/Case.Study.-.Cyclistic.Presentation.pptx) or as a pdf if you prefer [Case Study - Cyclistic Presentation.pdf](https://github.com/pj2911/pj2911/files/8771209/Case.Study.-.Cyclistic.Presentation.pdf)

üìàHere is another example of some more reports I've created in Power BI. These are mockups of sales dashbaords based on fictictous data: [PBI Report Sample.pdf](https://github.com/pj2911/pj2911/files/8797487/PBI.Report.Sample.pdf)
