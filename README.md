👀 Hi, I’m Peter, I've recently embarked on a new career path in data analytics, and this is my portfolio page to showcase my work. 📫 If you want to know a little bit more about me, please read my bio. 

⏳ I only started building this page on the 24th May 2022, so there is only a small amount of content at the moment. I'll be adding more content in the near future as I try to showcase the various technical skills I've developed over the last few months.

🌱 My first project is a case study to complete the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate", please check out the following links for details...

This pdf contains an export of the reports I built in Power BI. [Case Study - Cyclistic.pdf](https://github.com/pj2911/pj2911/files/8771087/Case.Study.-.Cyclistic.pdf)

This presentation provides an overview of the project including: Business Task, Key Observations, Conclusions & Next Steps and Appendix
